Dynamic [[RAM]] 
- most common, 
- each memory cell holds 1 bit and made up of 2 parts: 
	- a transistor 
	- capacitor
- Capacitor holds the bit and the transistor lets control circuitry on the memory chip read the capacitor or change its state
- The capacitor will leak and thus needs to be refreshed so the memory controller reads the memory and then writes it right back.Â
