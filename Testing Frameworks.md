According to ChatGPT, as of January 2022, Google Test and Catch2 were among the most popular testing frameworks for C++ codebases based on usage.


**[[Google Test (gtest)]]:**

**Pros:**

1. **Mature and Widely Adopted:** Google Test is a mature and widely adopted testing framework for C++ with a large user base. This means you can find extensive documentation, resources, and community support.

2. **Rich Assertion Macros:** Google Test provides a rich set of assertion macros that make it easy to write clear and expressive test cases.

3. **Test Discovery:** It can automatically discover and run your tests, making it easy to manage large test suites.

4. **Integration with Google Mock:** If you need to use mock objects in your tests, Google Test can be easily integrated with Google Mock for this purpose.

**Cons:**

1. **Slightly Heavier Setup:** Setting up Google Test can be slightly more involved compared to some other frameworks.

2. **C++ Syntax:** Some users find its assertion macros and syntax to be less user-friendly than other testing frameworks like Catch2.

**Catch2:**

**Pros:**

1. **Lightweight and Easy to Set Up:** Catch2 is known for its simplicity and ease of setup. You can often get started with minimal configuration.

2. **Natural Language Expression:** Catch2's assertion macros use a more natural language syntax, making it highly readable and user-friendly.

3. **Single-Header:** Catch2 is often distributed as a single-header library, which simplifies integration into your project.

4. **Test Discovery:** Like Google Test, Catch2 also supports test discovery.

**Cons:**

1. **Smaller Ecosystem:** Catch2 might not have as extensive an ecosystem or community support as Google Test, which can limit resources and plugins available.

2. **Limited Built-in Mocking:** Catch2 has limited built-in mocking capabilities compared to Google Test integrated with Google Mock.


## Adding Test Framework to Projects

It's generally a good practice to clone Google Test (gtest) separately from your project repository. This separation allows you to manage your project and testing framework independently and keeps your project repository cleaner. Here are a few reasons why it's a good idea to keep them separate:

1. **Cleaner Version Control History:** If you clone Google Test separately, you won't clutter your project's version control history with the testing framework's code and commits. This can make it easier to navigate your project's history.

2. **Easier Maintenance:** Managing Google Test separately means you can update the framework independently of your project. This is particularly useful if you want to stay up-to-date with the latest releases or security updates for Google Test without affecting your project code.

3. **Reusability:** Separating Google Test from your project makes it easier to reuse the testing framework for multiple projects if needed.

4. **Build System Independence:** Your project may use different build systems (CMake, Makefile, Visual Studio, etc.), and having Google Test separate from your project allows you to handle its build system requirements independently.

Here's how you can structure your directories:

```plaintext
- MyProject/
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - src/
  - include/
  - tests/
- googletest/
```

In this structure, "MyProject" is your project directory, and "googletest" is where you've cloned Google Test. Your CMake or other build system configuration can reference the "googletest" directory as needed.

This separation allows you to integrate Google Test into your project while keeping it cleanly organized.
