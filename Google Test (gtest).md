Integrating Google Test (gtest) into your C++ codebase involves several steps. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Download Google Test:**
   - You can download Google Test from its GitHub repository: https://github.com/google/googletest
   - Clone or download the repository to your development environment.

2. **Build Google Test:**
   - Google Test provides CMake support, which simplifies the build process. You can use CMake to build Google Test for your project. Here's a basic example of how to do it:

   ```shell
   cd googletest
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   This will build the Google Test library.

3. **Integrate Google Test with Your Project:**
   - Link your project with the Google Test library. You can add it to your CMake project using `target_link_libraries`:

   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(your_project_name gtest gtest_main)
   ```

   Replace `your_project_name` with the name of your CMake target.

4. **Write Test Cases:**
   - Create C++ source files with your test cases. These files should include the Google Test headers and define test cases using the `TEST` macro. Here's a simple example:

   ```cpp
   #include <gtest/gtest.h>

   TEST(TestCaseName, TestName) {
       // Your test assertions go here
       ASSERT_EQ(1, 1);
   }
   ```

5. **Build and Run Tests:**
   - Build your project as you normally would, and the test executable will be generated.
   - Run the test executable to execute your Google Test test cases. The executable typically has the name of your project with a `_test` suffix.

6. **View Test Results:**
   - Google Test will provide detailed test results in the console. It will show which test cases passed or failed and any associated error messages.

7. **Add More Test Cases:**
   - Continue adding test cases to cover your codebase. Google Test allows you to organize your tests into test suites and define test fixtures for common setup and teardown.

8. **Incorporate Continuous Integration:**
   - If you're using continuous integration, configure your CI pipeline to run the tests regularly.

Google Test provides extensive documentation and examples, which can help you get started and make the most of its features. Be sure to consult the official documentation and adapt the integration process to your specific build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile, Visual Studio project).

Please note that the specific steps may vary depending on your build system and the structure of your C++ project, so consult the documentation for your chosen build system for more details.


## For an [[MBED OS]] Project

Setting up Google Test (gtest) for a project based on Mbed OS might require some adjustments due to the specific build and structure of Mbed OS projects. Mbed OS uses its own build system and has specific requirements, so you'll need to integrate Google Test within this context. Here's a high-level guide for setting up gtest in an Mbed OS project:

1. **Create a Test Directory:**
   In your Mbed OS project, create a directory for your tests. You might name it something like "tests" or "unit_tests."

2. **Clone Google Test:**
   Clone Google Test separately, as mentioned earlier, and place it outside your Mbed OS project directory. This keeps your project and testing framework separate.

3. **Configure CMake:**
   If your Mbed OS project uses CMake as its build system, you can configure CMake to build your test suite. You should define your test suite in your project's CMakeLists.txt file, specifying the source files and any necessary dependencies, including Google Test.

   Here's a basic example of how to add test support in your CMakeLists.txt:

   ```cmake
   enable_testing()

   add_subdirectory(path/to/googletest)
   include_directories(path/to/googletest/googletest/include)

   add_executable(your_test_suite
       test1.cpp
       test2.cpp
   )

   target_link_libraries(your_test_suite gtest_main)

   add_test(NAME your_test_suite COMMAND your_test_suite)
   ```

   Replace "path/to/googletest" with the actual path to your Google Test source.

4. **Write Your Tests:**
   Inside your "tests" directory, create test files using Google Test as described in a previous response.

5. **Build and Run Tests:**
   Build your project with the added test suite using Mbed OS's build tools or your CMake build system. This will generate an executable for your tests. Run the executable to execute your Google Test test cases.

6. **View Test Results:**
   Google Test will provide detailed test results in the console, just as in a standard CMake project.

The specifics of setting up Google Test in an Mbed OS project can vary depending on your project's structure and build system. Ensure that you consult Mbed OS documentation and adapt the integration process accordingly to fit the conventions and requirements of Mbed OS.

Additionally, consider that Mbed OS may have its own testing framework or conventions, so you should check if there are any Mbed-specific testing options or recommendations for testing within the Mbed ecosystem.
