# Introduction to Data Structures
A data structure is a collection of values.
Algorithms are the steps or processes we put in place to manipulate these collections of values.

Someone who understands both is a great programmer.

## What is a Data Structure
A container of sorts; different containers are suitable for different storage needs.
Structures are used to organize data effectively.

Understand:
1. How to build them
2. How to use them

## How Computers Store Data
Resources for better understanding data storage on computers:

## Operations on Data Structures 
**Insertion**: insert data item to an index of the data structure

**Deletion**: delete data item from an index of the data structure

**Traversal**: access each data item once so it can be processed

**Searching**: find the location of a data item if it exists 

**Sorting**: rearrange data into an organized arrangement

**Access**: accessing data items in the data structure
