Standard Random Access Memory is a form of RAM that retains data as long as power is being supplied to the system. Flip-flop registers comprising of 4-6 transistors along with some wiring hold each bit but never have to be refreshed. 

Difference between SRAM and [[DRAM]]:
- SRAM retains charge and does not need to be refreshed to retain charge
- DRAM does not retain charge over time and thus, must frequently refresh capacitors to retain data

Advantages:
- Since SRAM retains data without the need for refreshing it is faster than DRAM 
- SRAM consumes less power than DRAM

Disadvantages
- Physically takes up more space than DRAM (less memory per chip)
- more expensive than DRAM
