APB is designed for low bandwidth control accesses, for example register interfaces on system peripherals. This bus has an address and data phase similar to AHB, but a much reduced, low complexity signal list (for example no bursts). It has to support 32bit and 66 MHz signals.
  

Example : [[SPI]], [[I2C]], [[Timer]], [[UART]], [[ADC]], etc
