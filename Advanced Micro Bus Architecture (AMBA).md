Standardizes on chip communication mechanisms between various functional blocks (or IP) for building high performance SOC designs. 

These designs typically have one or more MCUs or MPUs along with several other components — internal memory or external memory bridge, DSP, DMA, accelerators and various other peripherals like USB, UART, PCIE, I2C etc — all integrated on a single chip. The primary motivation of AMBA protocols is to have a standard and efficient way to interconnect these blocks with re-use across multiple designs.
